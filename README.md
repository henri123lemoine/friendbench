# FriendBench

The official website of the FriendBench™ AI model friendliness benchmark.

Available at [friendbench.ai](https://friendbench.ai).

The model and quote data live in `.jsonc` files under `data/` so you can keep
inline `// comments` or temporarily comment out entries. They are served at
runtime by a Netlify Function (`/.netlify/functions/get-data`). To display a
subset of models, pass a comma separated `models` query parameter in the URL.
