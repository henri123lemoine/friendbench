# FriendBench

The official website of the FriendBench™ AI model friendliness benchmark.

Available at [friendbench.ai](https://friendbench.ai).

The model and quote data are stored in JSON files under `data/` and served at
runtime by a Netlify Function (`/.netlify/functions/get-data`). To display a
subset of models, pass a comma separated `models` query parameter in the URL.
